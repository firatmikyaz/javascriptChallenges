# JavaScript Fundamentals â€“ Part 1

## LECTURE: Values and Variables

### Your tasks:

1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
   assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
2. Log their values to the console

## LECTURE: Data Types

### Your tasks:

1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your
   country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
   'language', but don't assign it any value yet
2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
   to the console

## LECTURE: let, const and var

### Your tasks:

1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
   countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
   change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens
