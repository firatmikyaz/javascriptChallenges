# JavaScript Challenges

## Coding Challenges #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height \*_ 2 = mass / (height _ height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).

### Your tasks:

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
   versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
   whether Mark has a higher BMI than John

### Test data:

-   Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
    m tall.
-   Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
    m tall.

## Coding Challenge #2

Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.

### Your tasks:

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
   is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
   BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

#### Hint: Use an if/else statement
