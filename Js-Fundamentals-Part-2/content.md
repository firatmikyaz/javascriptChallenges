# JavaScript Fundamentals â€“ Part 1

## LECTURE: Functions

### Your tasks:

1. Write a function called 'describeCountry' which takes three parameters:
   'country', 'population' and 'capitalCity'. Based on this input, the
   function returns a string with this format: 'Finland has 6 million people and its
   capital city is Helsinki'
2. Call this function 3 times, with input data for 3 different countries. Store the
   returned values in 3 different variables, and log them to the console

## LECTURE: Function Declarations vs. Expressions

### Your tasks:

1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration
   called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and
   returns the percentage of the world population that the given population
   represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of
   the world population
2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900
   and then multiply by 100
3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice,
   store the results into variables, and log them to the console
4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called
   'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be
   the same populations)

## LECTURE: Arrow Functions

### Your tasks:

1. Recreate the last assignment, but this time create an arrow function called
   'percentageOfWorld3'

## LECTURE: Functions Calling Other Functions

### Your tasks:

1. Create a function called 'describePopulation'. Use the function type you
   like the most. This function takes in two arguments: 'country' and
   'population', and returns a string like this: 'China has 1441 million people,
   which is about 18.2% of the world.'
2. To calculate the percentage, 'describePopulation' call the
   'percentageOfWorld1' you created earlier
3. Call 'describePopulation' with data for 3 countries of your choice
